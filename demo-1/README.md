# Demo-1

This is a demo of how a shiny app is structured.  It shows a 2-file
setup, the same Old Faithful app that RStudio creates as shiny
template. 

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository,
follow the instructions in the `exercise.R` file, then `add` and
`commit` your changes so that you can `push` them back up to GitHub.
