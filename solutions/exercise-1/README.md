# Exercise-1

In this exercise, you'll practice loading functions from multiple
files.  You have two tasks:

* Create a function that plots an arbitrary dataset (given as a
  parameter to the function).  The function will be saved in _scripts_
  directory. 
* Source that file in another script and use the function to create a
  scatterplot.

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository,
follow the instructions in the `exercise.R` file, then `add` and
`commit` your changes so that you can `push` them back up to GitHub.
